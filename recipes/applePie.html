      <li>Add the flour, salt and sugar if using to a large mixing bowl.</li>
      <li>Cut the butter into small cubes and add to the mixing bowl.</li>
      <li>Use clean dry hands to rub the butter into the flour until it resembled sand.</li>
      <li>Spoon in a few tablespoons of ice water and mix the pastry with a knife.</li>
      <li>Form the dough into a ball and knead for 30 seconds on a floured surface until smooth.</li>

      <li>Peel, core and thinly slice the apples and place into a large bowl.</li>
      <li>Add the sugar, flour, cinnamon, salt, and lemon into the bowl. Mix until well combined.</li>
      <li>Divide the pastry into two and roll each into a large disc.</li>
      <li>Place one disc of pastry into a pie dish and cut off any excess leaving about an inch of over hang.</li>
      <li>Pour all of the apples and any juice into the pie dish and top with the second pastry disc.</li>
      <li>Cut off any excess pastry and use your fingers and thumb to create a decorated edge.</li>
      <li>Place the pie into the fridge for at least 30 minutes before baking.</li>
      <li>Bake the pie in a 200C | 400F oven for 45-50 minutes or until the pastry is golden brown.</li>
